I have completed the above assignment. I had completed the assignment within 2 days. This project has been deployed on https://kavintasky.herokuapp.com/ on this website. But, in this project, I didn't use the redux concept. I'm just a student, I'm studying the redux concept. Apart from In this project, I have used some extra functionalities and also implemented backend security codings. like, client and admin roles, privileges, mail triggers, some medium-level validations. 

## Overview:
goto https://kavintasky.herokuapp.com/. create an account and verify the email. then login to your account. Once you logged in you can see the list of your task. On this page, if you completed the work update the status to admin by clicking the yes/no button. 

Then, for the admin side, Go to the above URL /login or /signup the same page for the admin.  You can also create an admin by using the sign-up page.
But, you should need an organization email,  the organization mail should be like kavin.com, ex, raja@kavin.com, ram@kavin.com. Other organization domains cannot accept for creating admin users.
